        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>When I was fourteen years old, I bought one of those fishnet style camping hammocks that come rolled up in a little box and strung it twenty feet off the ground between two upper branches of a giant tree in my back yard. I’d learned from reading Spiderman comic books that people seldom if ever look up. Old Spidey often evaded cops and robbers alike by clinging silently to the ceiling right over their heads until they went away, grumbling in amazement at his uncanny ability to vanish into thin air. I was one of four family members, three of us adolescents, living in a four room house in a small town; one of my chief concerns, understandably, I think, was privacy. I’d wanted my own place to vanish to when the world below became uncomfortably crowded, and the hammock became my web, hanging invisibly in a vertical dimension people seldom explored.

        I fashioned four hooks out of old dog leash clips to hold the edges of the hammock together, so I’d be in no danger of tumbling to my death if I fell asleep up there. I’d climb up into the tree, wrap the hammock’s netting tightly around me, fasten the hooks, and swing silently in the breeze like a caterpillar spun safely into his comfortable cocoon. I’d read or sleep or simply listen to the breeze tugging my tether ropes gently to and fro until the soft sounds and motion lulled me into a meditational Theta-state, a perfect calm in a world where I was perfectly alone, only twenty feet away from all the commotion of life.

          And no one ever looked up.

          European witches are said to have used a device called a witch’s cradle to reach mystical states of awareness and even leave their bodies to travel astrally through the countryside. The witch’s cradle was a sort of body-wrapping, like two heavy blankets sewn together with the witch inside, that dangled and swayed at the end of a rope . Modern consciousness researchers (I’m pretty sure I first learned about the witch’s cradle reading John Lilly) consider the device a precursor to the sensory deprivation tank, made famous in the movie Altered States, in which a person floats in total darkness on the surface of salt-saturated, body temperature water, allowing the exploration of inner states of consciousness through the elimination of outer sensory distractions.

        It would be a few years before I learned of sensory deprivation technology (when Altered States came out on Christmas Day, 1980), and another decade before I read about the witch’s cradle, but there in my small town back yard, at the age of fourteen, I was unwittingly participating in the four-dimensional time-body of the idea underlying both. As the breeze rocked my hammock, and I experienced the change in brain-state my suspension made possible, my life became a thread in the historical fabric connecting the witches cradle to the sensory deprivation tank and beyond. The connection was made, in that moment, through me. My hammock, with me in it, existed for moment in the four-dimensional time-body of the idea informing both the witch’s cradle and the sensory deprivation tank. My experience allowed me, once I’d learned of these two devices separated by hundreds of years, to make the connection between past and present and to carry the idea into the future — in this essay, for example, which is itself now a part of that time-body.

        And which, by the way, weaves you, as you read these words, into that same body. By making you aware of these connections, I am granting you participation in them.</p>
